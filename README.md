## Simple Extract to Excel


</div>

### Description

This is just a simple extract from a flexgrid to excel.
 
### More Info
 
The application gives a sample data in the flexgrid and allows the user to extract the data to excel. It also has a functionality to filter odd/even rows and dumps only the data seen in the flexgrid/table.

Please comment on the code. I would like though to start the excel application showing its flash screen. I hope someone can help me with it. In my code, after extracting the data and you close the workbook alone not the excel application, excel will still close. Worst is, it leaves an excel process in the memory.
